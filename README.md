Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The main goal of the app I developed, WeightTracker, is to help its users reach their target weight. The app allows users to create an account that gives them the ability to record their daily
weights, with the ability to add or delete certain information if neccessary, and get a notification when they reach their specified goal weight. The app helps address the need
to record the progress made in their weight journey.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To help support user needs and create a user-centered UI, I included several different screens to separate the main functions of the app. For example, there is a login screen,
register screen for new users, a screen that displays the recorded weights, and a page where users can add a new weight. By dividing these major functions into separate screens,
it helps keep the app organized and simple to navigate for users. The app appears less cluttered by not having all the tasks on one page, as well as more organized by ensuring that 
all the major tasks that are needed for the user to accomplish their goals are there. I also included toast messages for many of the tasks that the user may complete in order to
give them an update on the status of their task. For example, toast messages exist in the scenario of an empty username or password parameter, if the user already exists, if a
weight was deleted successfully, or if a weight already exists for the date the user has entered. These messages help guide the user throughout the app and make for an overall
more intuitive experience. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

While I did experience some difficulty within the procress of coding my app, I was able to break it down into smaller pieces that really helped it become more managable. At
first, I designed the layout of my app. I did this because it was the easiest coded portion for me, and I felt it was important to know what my app will look like, as well as
all the neccesary items, before beginning the actual coded portion of the app. Then, I started with the main activity and trying to declare all the variables I will need. 
I then moved onto the database, creating both the tables for the login information and the recorded weights. Lastly, I created the java files for the weight activity and 
additional features, such as registering a user or adding a new weight to the user's record. In the future, I beleive breaking down the project, completing the "big picture"
tasks first, and then moving onto the smaller detailed components will be a helpful strategy when completing larger projects.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I used the Android Studio's emulator to test my code and ensure it was functional. I must have done this over 200 times, as it revealed what I thought was working was 
actually not. This trial and error process helped me analyze my code more, better understanding the meaning behind it. As I worked through this procress, I was able
to find the issues and fix them, making my app more functional for the user. This process of testing an app is important because it helps the developer view the app
from the user's perspective and find issues or bugs that may be hidden just by looking at the code. The use of the emulator really helped with this process and gave me
a better understanding of what my code was doing.


Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Throughout the entire development process, I had the hardest time with creating and connecting to the database. I tried many different versions of declaring a database and
connecting it to my app so that my date and weight would display on the screen. I experienced issues such as only the date displaying on the screen, the date only displaying
if I log out and back into the app, the weights showing up even if I log into a different account, or the dates not being able to be deleted. While I still experienced
some of these issues in my final design of the app, I do feel as though I have a better grasp on the concept of a SQLite database and was able to fix several of the issues
I experienced at first. 


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe I was successful in creating an intuitive and user-friendly app layout. I included different screens for each of the major app functions that help the user accomplish
their goals without getting dragged down by the need to learn how to navigate throughout the app. I created a cohesive design that looks unified and organized. In addition, I 
believe the app is simple enough to be used by a wide variety of users, but yet still contains all the neccessary functions needed for the app to be successful.
